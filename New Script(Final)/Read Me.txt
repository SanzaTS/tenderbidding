The database script is the final i added some new tenders to make a bid simpler.

When registering a new user In a dropdown select the "Informatio Technology" option to make sure you get as much tender you can.

The reason why a we use a username for login its because the Admin and Bidder are in a same table Called users so we cant have the bidder registering with a company number
and the Admin do the same.
So Admin Table  and A bidder Table they link to the User.

Filtering its when You do search either with a search bar or dropdown or radio group so when they ask for filter ring in the use Allb Bids page they is filtering
also in admin (Admin Reports the first on on manu )its there .


When log in as a bidder it takes you to a page that show tenders.
You make a bid and after you done it takes you to and page that show tenders you have bidded for youl see " my bids"

You can go to status to see tenders that are close and youll see an winner.

if the due date is close  it will automatically send a winner a notification to inform him that he has won.

When login as a Admin

it takes you to page where admin we view tenders.
Admin add add an Admin Dynamically a bidder can not be changed to an Admin because he an extenal user

on send notification you can communicate with every user.

the admin reports show admin related reports like All tenders and when you click status then it shows you users per tenderwho have bidded and the status ,
Users it shows bidders on as system you can delete the but not update them.
 AND number of users who have bids per user.

status show admin all winnes in every tender when a tender is closed.
